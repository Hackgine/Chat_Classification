# Chat_Classification

A simple structured program containing text classification algorithm using sklearn library in python

It uses Support Vector Machine sklearn implementation algorithm and Naive Bayes sklearn implementaton algorithm to classify a custom text, extracted from a chat with I and a friend of mine. the score is quite low due to data insufficiencies. But it basically shows the time it takes for each computational graph to fit

The data is first loaded into a bag of data for cross_validation and splitting, after which vectorization is done on the data.
