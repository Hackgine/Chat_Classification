# Chat_Classification

A simple structured file containing text classification algorithm using sklearn lib in python

It uses Support Vector Machine sklearn implementation algorithm and Naive Bayes sklearn implementaton algorithm to classify a custom text, extracted from a chat with I and a friend of mine. the score is quite low due to data insufficiencies. But it basically shows the time it takes for each computational graph to fit
